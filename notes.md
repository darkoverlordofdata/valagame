# where does this go?

Everything pretty much works in vala. This all came together so smoothly I didn't notice how much was done until I shifted gears to Nim.

Nim is interesting, new and shiny. It's also slow. Not the compiler. That's fast. But the language constraints slow down the whole design process, like coding in molasses. That may change as I get more used to it.

Kotlin - even newer an shinier, I prefer scala, but scala-native is not ready for windows. A serious miscalculation from the scala team. Kotlin get's that part right. And it's a pretty good language.


## other goals

can target emscripten 

monogame style main loop

sdl2 only 
use sdl_gpu for sprite batching?

## Nim
so many constraints

## Kotlin-native
slow compiler
still very beta
